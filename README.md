# minSOM

A simple implementation of the self-organizing map. The implementation is based on the description of SOM given by Kohonen in chapter 3 of his book _Self-Organizing Maps_. This is mostly a personal study on how the algorithm can be implemented and not meant to be a viable way for someone to analyze large datasets.
